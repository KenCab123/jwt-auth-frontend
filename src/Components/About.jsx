        In the first half of my life, I was a performer, drawn to the stage and the art of expression. Yet, beyond the lights, I found another love: food. Eating, sleeping, exploringâ€”it's my joy. And when day turns to night, there's nothing like the comfort of sleep, a time for renewal and rest. So, that's me: performer, food lover, and appreciator of sleep's embrace.
